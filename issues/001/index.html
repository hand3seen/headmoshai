HEADMOSH / ISSUE 001


PAGE 1 — COVER

HEADMOSH

issue 001


PAGE 2 — THE SHIFT

You can stop mid-thought.

You can leave the door open.

You can decide later
that later was enough.


PAGE 3 — OFFERINGS

a page left blank
because it was doing its job

the word “almost”
left where it fell

a wolf looking away
on purpose

an arrow that points back
but doesn’t insist

a note that says:
“leave this”
and is obeyed


PAGE 4 — EXIT

Nothing broke.
