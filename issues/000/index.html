HEADMOSH / ISSUE 000

PAGE 1 — COVER
HEADMOSH
issue 000

PAGE 2 — THE PERMISSION
You don’t have to finish.
You don’t have to explain.
You don’t have to post.

You’re allowed to make something
and leave it half alive.

PAGE 3 — OFFERINGS
a wolf drawn from memory,
missing a leg

a note that says:
“too early”
circled twice

a diagram that doesn’t help
but feels important

an arrow pointing nowhere
with confidence

a joke written,
then erased,
then left erased

something started
because the pen was already uncapped

PAGE 4 — EXIT
Headmosh exists because making things
feels better than not making things.
